This app is bsed on dataset from Beijing mobile phone signal September 1st to 15th 2017.

Becuase every base station has their own location and number.
So I modified them by Grid number and time.
The original data, we have the data each two hours. 
The grids location are made by Latitude and longitude.
I combined the location data with the time data.
We can check the arrival people and departure people.


IMPORTANT
the data is too large, so we need a little patience to wait it working.
